## Introduction

My Baby Journey ("we", "our", or "the app") is a baby tracking application designed to help parents monitor their baby's feeding, sleep, diaper changes, growth, medications, and milestones. Your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect, how we use it, and your choices.
